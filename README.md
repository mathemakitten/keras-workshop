# Hello!

This workshop is an introduction to Keras, as presented at EngHacks 2018 in Waterloo, Canada.

To follow along with this workshop, you should install the following:

- Python 3
- Numpy
- TensorFlow
- Keras

## Installation

If you haven't installed Python 3 already, I would highly recommend installing via Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/download/

If you have already installed Python 3, you can just install the following libraries: 

- `pip3 install numpy`
- `pip3 install scipy`
- `pip3 install tensorflow`
- `pip3 install keras`

And you're all set!

## Getting ready

Open up your favourite terminal window and type `python3`. You should get `>>>`! 

Try testing your Keras installation by running `import keras`. You should see the following: 

    >>> import keras
    Using TensorFlow backend.
For this workshop, you can get the notebooks by running the following from Git: 

`git clone git@github.com:mathemakitten/keras-workshop.git`
